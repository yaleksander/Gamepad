The analog sticks work on the menus as well. You can change the deadzone and there are event triggers to enable you to set up the hero object movement. For more information, visit https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/\n\nHow to use: on the details tab, define the ID of the variable that will hold the deadzone value, as well as the IDs of the events that will trigger upon detecting left and right analog stick movement. Then, set up event triggers for the analog sticks. The events are sent with parameters [id, x, y]. Set all parameters to \"anything\". id is the ID of the controller, from 1 to 4, sorted by which was connected first. x and y range from -1 to 1: x = -1 is left; x = 1 is right; y = -1 is up; y = 1 is down. You'll get decimal values most of the time.\n\nTip: you can't set up gamepad buttons on the engine, but you can do so in-game in the title settings menu.","name":"Gamepad","parameters":[{"defaultValue":{"k":12,"v":26},"description":"The deadzone changes according to the value stored in the variable of given ID (must be between 0 and 1)","id":-1,"name":"Deadzone variable ID"},{"defaultValue":{"k":12,"v":8},"description":"ID of the event that triggers when left analog stick moves","id":-1,"name":"Left stick event ID"},{"defaultValue":{"k":12,"v":9},"description":"ID of the event that triggers when right analog stick moves","id":-1,"name":"Right stick event ID"}],"version":"1.0.3","website":"https://github.com/yaleksander/RPM-Plugin-Gamepad"}
